NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF STOCHASTIC SIR EPIDEMICAL MODEL

MATLAB Simulation of a stochastic epidemic model adapted from the "Jiang, Daqing, et al., Asymptotic behavior of global positive solution to a stochastic SIR model (2011)." The model was discretized by the Euler-Maruyama and Milstein Higher Order Method from "Higham, Desmond J., An algorithmic introduction to numerical simulation of stochastic differential equations." SIAM review 43.3 (2001)."
